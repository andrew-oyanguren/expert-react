# Project Overview

This project will have a focus on mastering React as a whole, as well as many commonly used React libraries.

## How will this be achieved?

Through the creation of custom components, with a TDD mindset, where creating testable resuable functions will be prioritized.
The tools I will be using are a variety of third party libraries, firebase, and good ol' google search.
